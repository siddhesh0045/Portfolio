               Hello, and welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Siddheshwar, and I'm currently pursuing my BTech degree in Electronics Engineering at <a class="clg" href="http://www.walchandsangli.ac.in/">Walchand College Of Engineering Sangli</a> .

                As a fresher, I am passionate about developement and excited to learn more about it.My philosophy is to continuously learn, grow, and evolve in my chosen field while striving to make a positive impact in the world, and I'm committed to working hard to achieve my goals in my field.
                
                Although I'm just starting out, I have already gained some experience through my projects. I have learned programming and developed problem solving skills, which I believe will serve me well as I continue to pursue my career in Software Engineering.

I believe in honesty, integrity, and transparency in all my interactions and relationships, and I am always looking for ways to give back to my community and help others.
